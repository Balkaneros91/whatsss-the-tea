# What's the Tea?

What's the Tea? is an idea I came up with just exclusivly for this project. The organization is located in Stockholm. The main goal is to spread positivity, care and love and everyone is welcome no matter the gender. The website presents a Home page with an 'About' and 'Contact & Info' section. The Gallery page is built from a bunch of inspirational lgbtq+ photos. And last but not least the Sign Up page contains the events sign up form.

I was inspired by the RuPaul's Drag Race show created by RuPaul Charles who is the ICON of the LGBTQ+ comunity all over the world. The show has grown a lot and as a member of the LGBTQ+ comunity I wanted to celebrate my pride by creating my first project based on this idea.
